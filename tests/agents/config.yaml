# Crust agent integration test configuration (v2 schema)
# Safe defaults: local Ollama — no real API key needed
#
# To customize, create config.local.yaml (gitignored) or set env vars:
#   CRUST_TEST_ENDPOINT, CRUST_TEST_API_KEY, CRUST_TEST_MODEL, CRUST_TEST_AGENT

  binary: "crust"

backend:
  endpoint: "http://localhost:11434/v1"   # Ollama OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  api_key: "ollama"                       # Ollama doesn't need a real key
  model: "qwen3"                          # Local model with tool support
  agent: "openclaw"                       # Tool name convention (see below)

# Agent determines which tool names are used in test payloads:
#   claude-code  → Bash, Read, Write, Edit, WebFetch
#   codex        → shell, read_file, apply_patch, web_search
#   cline        → execute_command, read_file, write_to_file, replace_in_file, browser_action
#   cursor       → run_terminal_cmd, read_file, edit_file, web_search
#   openclaw     → exec, Read, Write, Edit, web_search
#   opencode     → bash, read, write, edit, websearch
#   windsurf     → run_command, read_file, write_to_file, edit_file, read_url_content
